# 🔋 DualSense Battery Monitor - Low Battery Warning Overlay for PS5 Controllers

## ⚡ Never Miss a Low Battery Warning Again
**DualSense Battery Monitor** is a lightweight Windows utility that automatically alerts you with a **visual overlay** whenever any connected **PlayStation 5 DualSense controller** reaches a low battery level.

* ✅ Auto-starts with Windows
* 🔋 Accurate battery monitoring every 5 seconds
* ⚠️ Only shows when battery is low
* 🧠 Silent and unobtrusive otherwise

## 🕹️ Use Case
This utility is perfect for:
* Users who use PS5 controllers on PC and want a non-intrusive, visual heads-up for low battery levels
* Multiplayer users with multiple controllers connected — the app tracks and displays each one with its own icon and battery status (Up to 4 DualSense controllers)
* Users using the DualSense controller as a pointer/input device

The app acts **only when needed**, showing a overlay with controller status **only when a low battery is detected**.

## 🧠 Features
* 🎮 **DualSense-aware overlay:** Shows connected PS5 controllers and their individual battery levels.
* ⚠️ **Low battery detection:** If any controller drops below 25%, the widget appears and below 15% the effected controller's battery icon will start flashing.
* 🔁 **5-second refresh rate:** Battery status updates frequently and efficiently.
* 🪛 **Automatic Windows startup:** Uses registry-based startup (no Task Scheduler required).
* 🧊 **Invisible when not needed:** If no controller is low on battery, the widget remains hidden.
* 🧪 **Tested with firmware A-0520** (latest as of June 11, 2025).
* 📦 **Framework-dependent and self-contained releases available.**
* 💡 **Built using .NET 8.0.**
